# PySpiralMatrix

A Python implementation to visualize a **spiral traversal** of a fixed 4x4 matrix. This repository demonstrates how to traverse a predefined matrix in a spiral order and visually represent the traversal using color coding in the terminal.

## Features
- Spiral traversal of a fixed 4x4 matrix.
- Animated visualization with color-coded elements.
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly Python code.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wyattmatt/PySpiralMatrix.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd PySpiralMatrix
   ```
3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment:
   
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install required packages (if any):
   
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the script to visualize the spiral traversal of the matrix:

```bash
python Matrix_Spiral.py
```

### Example Output
For the 4x4 matrix:
```
1   2   3   4
5   6   7   8
9  10  11  12
13  14  15  16
```
The script will display an animated spiral traversal of the matrix with color coding.

## Customization
The matrix is currently hardcoded as a 4x4 grid. You can modify the `matrix` variable in `Matrix_Spiral.py` to use a different matrix, but it must have a fixed size.
